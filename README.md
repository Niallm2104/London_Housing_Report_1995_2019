# London_Housing_Report_1995_2019
Introduction
A look into housing in the U.K and London charting how areas, salaries, crime rates and more, have changed over the last 24 years. Using data collected from 44 areas monthly since 1996 and 50 areas yearly since 1999 there is a fantastic scope to chart changes in salaries, crime rates, housing prices and much more.

Data
Source is a combination of:
https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/housing-in-london?select=housing_in_london_yearly_variables.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/housing-in-london?select=housing_in_london_monthly_variables.csv

There are 6 total variables for monthly data (date, area, average price, area code, houses sold and no of crimes) and 14 total variables for the yearly data ( all of monthly and median salary, life satisfaction, mean salary, recycling participation, population, number of jobs, size of area(hectares) and the number of houses). 
The date of the record is given 
Then the name of the area is given 
The average house price in the area
The area code
The amount of houses sold in the area that month
The number of crimes that month
The median salary in the area that year
The average life satisfaction for a person living in the area that year
The percentage of residents that recycle
The population in the area
The number of jobs in the area
The size of the area in hectares 
And the number of houses in the area


With data from 44 areas over 24 years we have over 13000 data points for data taken monthly, and with data from 50 areas over 21 years with over 1000 data points for yearly data.



Reason for Selection
I think this is a very interesting data set that will show the growth of London over the past 24 years. I chose this dataset because I think it could provide very interesting insights into different
aspects of not only London, but other cities with factors such as wealth distribution and crime rates affecting the data. Using this data we can provide suggestions as to where a local government might have to focus its resources in order to improve life for its area's inhabitants.

Proposed Analysis
Using this dataset I plan to:
Examine how different areas grew based on population, salaries and crime rates. 
Analyse how salaries have grown and whether higher salaries equates to higher house prices in the area and whether crime rates are lower given higher salaries. 
Study the population distribution based on mean income and provide insights as to whether lower income areas would have higher population density or if it would be the opposite.
Determine if their is any correlation between crime rates, population density and mean salaries 
Observe how crime rates affect house prices and house sales
and more.
